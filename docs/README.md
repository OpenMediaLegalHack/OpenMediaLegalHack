Throughout the month of October, chapters of [Legal Hackers](http://legalhackers.org) are convening events around the world to enable a broad range of diverse participants to collaborate on generating creative projects, key questions and new ideas.  This work will be reviewed and discussed at the capstone Hackathon day on October 27, 2018 at the MIT Media Lab.
